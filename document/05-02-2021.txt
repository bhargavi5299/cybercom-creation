****OOPS Concept*****
1)class and object:-
	A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of class.
	We can create multiple objects from a class. 
	Each object has all the properties and methods defined in the class, but they will have different 	property values.
2)Constructor:
	A constructor allows you to initialize an object's properties upon creation of the object.

3)Constants :-
	Constants are like variables except that once they are defined they cannot be changed or 	undefined.
	Constants are automatically global and can be used across the entire script.

4)Properties and methods can have access modifiers which control where they can be accessed.
	public - the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is default.
	protected - the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from 		that class.
	private - the property or method can ONLY be accessed within the class.
5)Inheritance :-
	The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent 		class. also it can have its own properties and methods.
6)Exception:-
	Exception handling is used to change the normal flow of the code execution if a specified error 	condition occurs. 

	try - A function using an exception should be in a "try" block. If the exception does not trigger, the 		code will continue as normal. However if the exception triggers, an exception is "thrown".

	throw - This is how you trigger an exception. Each "throw" must have at least one "catch".

	catch - A "catch" block retrieves an exception and creates an object containing the exception 			information.
