**************HTML AND JS***********

1)Arrow Function:-
		Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:
			hello = () => {
  			return "Hello!";
			}
	
2)Arrow function with laxical:-

		In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, 				which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.

		With arrow functions the this keyword always represents the object that defined the 				arrow function.

3)Destructuring:-
		Destructuring implies breaking down a complex structure into simpler parts.
		We can use destructuring in function and object.
4)Array:-
		new array methods are added in ES6 like Array.from(),findIndex(),find().
		Array.from():-It converts array-like values and iterable values into arrays.
		Array.findIndex():-The Array.findIndex() returns the index of the first element of the given 		array that satisfies the given condition.
		Array.find():-It finds a value from an array, based on the specific criteria that are passed 			to this method.
		
5)Fieldset(html) :-	The <fieldset> tag is used to group related elements in a form.
