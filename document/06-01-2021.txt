Today i learn different command of git .
1)git diff(compare working directory to stage directory)
2)git rm (for delete file)
3)git rm --cached(only untracked file not remove)
4)git status -s( show the modified data)
5)git log (shown how many people commit)
6)git log - p -1(like that we add any number of line so we clear about commit at line)
7)git merge head(show at which point it differ)
8)git branch(create,delete branch)
9)git revert(two purpose for reveret the file and delete the data specific which we will revert)
i keep learning those command so that i more and more clear about that.otherwise day was good.
Thank you.
